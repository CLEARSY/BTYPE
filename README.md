# BTYPE Library

## Overview

BTYPE is a C++ library designed to represent the B language type system. It is thread-safe and implements maximal sharing of subtypes. It also includes a visitor pattern and a formatter suitable for the `fmt` library.

## Features

- Basic Types: Integer, Boolean, Float, Real, String
- Complex Types: Product, Power Set, Abstract Set, Enumerated Set, Struct
- Type Comparisons: Equality, Inequality, Less than, Greater than, etc.
- Visitor Pattern: For type-specific operations
- Thread Safety: Ensures safe operations in multi-threaded environments
- Maximal Sharing: Efficient memory usage by sharing common subtypes

## Installation

To build and install the BTYPE library, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CLEARSY/BTYPE.git
cd btype
```

Create a build directory and navigate to it:
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
```

Run CMake to configure the project:

```sh
cmake ..
```

Build the project:

```sh
make
```

(Optional) Run tests to verify the build:

```sh
ctest
```

##Â Usage
Include the BTYPE library in your project by adding the following include directive:

```cpp
#include "btype.h"
```

## Example
Here is a simple example demonstrating the creation and usage of various types:

```
#include "btype.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    auto integerType = BTypeFactory::Integer();
    auto booleanType = BTypeFactory::Boolean();
    auto productType = BTypeFactory::Product(integerType, booleanType);
    auto powerType = BTypeFactory::PowerSet(integerType);

    std::cout << "Integer Type: " << integerType->getKind() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Boolean Type: " << booleanType->getKind() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Product Type: " << productType->getKind() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Power Type: " << powerType->getKind() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Testing

The BTYPE library includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the correctness and reliability of the types and their operations. The tests are located in the tests directory and can be run using ctest.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the build directory and execute:

```sh
ctest
```

The output will show the results of the tests, including any failures or errors.
